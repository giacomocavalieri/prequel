To define a hierarchy inside an entity you first have to specify if it is

For example:

  entity test_entity {
    total disjoint hierarchy {
    ┬─────────────

To define a hierarchy inside an entity you first have to specify if it is

    ┆   ╰─ Relationships can only be defined with the `relationship` keyword
    ┆      at the top level of a file

(a) If you want to quickly define a binary relationship between two entites you can
use the `->` lollipop inside one of the two entities.
For example:

entity test_entity_1
entity test_entity_2 {
    -> rel : (1-1) test_entity_1 (0-N)
    ┬─────────────────────────────────
    ╰─ This means that `test_entity_1` and `test_entity_2` take part in a
       relationship called `rel` with respective cardinalities of (0-N) and
       (1-1)
}

The same relationship could also have been defined in a slighly more verbose way
as:

entity test_entity_1
entity test_entity_2
relationship rel {
  -> test_entity_1 : (0-N)
  -> test_entity_2 : (1-1)
}
